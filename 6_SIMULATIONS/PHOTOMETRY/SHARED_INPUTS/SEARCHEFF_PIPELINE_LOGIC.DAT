DOCUMENTATION:
    PURPOSE: trigger logic for surveys
    INTENT:  Nominal
    USAGE_KEY:  SEARCH_PIPELINE_LOGIC
    USAGE_CODE: snlc_sim.exe
    TEST_CODE:     used in multiple SNIa-cosmology analyses
    TEST_SCIENCE:  used in multiple SNIa-cosmology analyses
    NOTES:
    - First number of survey name is number of epochs required.
    - Second arguyment is the logic for a single-epoch detection.
    - Example  gr -> require both g and r detections.
    - Example  gr+ri -> require g & r, or require r & i.
    - Eff vs SNR/MAG is defined in SEARCHEFF_[SNR,MAG]_[SURVEY].DAT 
    - Does not include image scanning from humans or automation.
